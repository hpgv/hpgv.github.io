# AAVE Price Pauses After 160% Surge â€“ Elliott Wave Analysis Predicts $245 Target  

Cryptocurrency markets thrive on technical analysis, and AAVE's recent price action offers compelling insights for investors. This decentralized finance (DeFi) token broke through critical resistance levels in 2024 after a sluggish 2023 performance, sparking renewed interest among traders. By examining Elliott Wave patterns and on-chain metrics, we uncover potential price targets and market dynamics shaping AAVE's trajectory.  

## AAVE's Technical Breakthrough  

The weekly AAVE/USDT chart reveals a bullish structure forming since June 2023.
