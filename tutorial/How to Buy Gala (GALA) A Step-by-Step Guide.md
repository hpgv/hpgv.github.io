## What is GALA?

**Gala Games** is a blockchain-based platform that integrates NFTs (non-fungible tokens) with play-to-earn mechanics, enabling players to earn rewards through gameplay and asset ownership. Launched in 2019, the platform has attracted over 1.3 million monthly active users and facilitated the sale of 26,000+ NFTs, with one digital asset reaching $3 million in value.

The **GALA token** serves as the native utility currency within this ecosystem, allowing:
- Purchase of in-game items
- Peer-to-peer transactions
- Rewards for node operators

Initially built on Ethereum, the token now operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) via the p.Network bridge, enhancing scalability and reducing transaction costs.

## Brief History of GALA

Gala Games introduced its token in September 2020 through a unique distribution model. Unlike traditional ICOs, GALA could only be earned by:
- Running Founderâ€™s Nodes
- Referring users to purchase nodes
- Playing platform games

With a maximum supply of 50 billion tokens, GALA undergoes annual halving events starting July 21, reducing daily emissions from 17.1 million to 8.56 million tokens. This deflationary mechanism mirrors Bitcoinâ€™s scarcity model, potentially driving long-term value.

The token surged over 81,000% in 2021, reaching an all-time high of $0.8367, fueled by NFT and play-to-earn trends. While price volatility remains significant, the projectâ€™s established user base and node infrastructure position it as a notable player in blockchain gaming.
