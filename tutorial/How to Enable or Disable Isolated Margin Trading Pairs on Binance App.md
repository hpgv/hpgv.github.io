# How to Enable or Disable Isolated Margin Trading Pairs on Binance App

## Introduction to Isolated Margin Trading  
Isolated margin trading allows traders to allocate specific capital to individual trading pairs while limiting potential losses to the collateral assigned. This risk management strategy is particularly valuable for cryptocurrency traders seeking controlled exposure. Binance provides an intuitive mobile interface for managing these settings, but users must understand the platform's limitations and procedures to optimize their trading experience.
