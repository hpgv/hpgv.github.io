## Step-by-Step: Locating Your Deposit Address

2. **Go to the Deposit Section**  
   - Desktop: Click **[Assets]** â†’ **[Deposit]**.  
   - Mobile: Tap **[Wallet]** â†’ **[Deposit]**.  

3. **Select the Cryptocurrency**  
   Search for the specific digital asset (e.g., **USDT**, **XRP**) and choose the correct blockchain network. For example:
