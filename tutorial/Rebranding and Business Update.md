# Rebranding and Business Update  

The transition from Okcoin Europe Ltd. to OKX in Europe marks a pivotal step in our commitment to delivering a seamless, user-centric crypto experience. As the General Manager for the region, my focus is on building localized teams that align with our global strategy while addressing the unique needs of our 50 million users worldwide. This rebranding reflects more than a name changeâ€”itâ€™s a dedication to enhancing platform accessibility, optimizing trading tools, and integrating preferred payment methods tailored to regional preferences.  

## Why the Rebranding Makes Sense  

Rebranding to OKX in Europe strengthens our brand identity, aligning with our global presence while emphasizing regulatory compliance and user trust. Since 2021, our services have been backed by rigorous licensing frameworks, including registration with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and a virtual financial asset service provider license in Malta. These foundations ensure we meet Europeâ€™s stringent financial regulations while maintaining the flexibility to innovate.

### Regulatory Foundations in Europe  
Our compliance efforts are rooted in two key jurisdictions:  
- **The Netherlands**: Operating under DNBâ€™s oversight, we prioritize transparency and user protection.  
- **Malta**: Our VFA license enables us to offer robust crypto services across the EU.  

Users will continue to be served by Okcoin Europe Ltd., now operating under the OKX brandâ€”a move designed to unify our global operations while amplifying our local impact.  

## Enhancing User Experience Through Localization  

Europeâ€™s digital economy thrives on diversity, and our rebranding prioritizes localized experiences. In the Netherlands, our platform is already in beta testing, with plans for a full launch soon. This phased approach allows us to refine features based on user feedback, such as:  
- **Regional payment gateways** for smoother fiat on-ramps.  
- **Language-specific support** to address community needs.  
- **Trading interface customization** reflecting local market trends.
