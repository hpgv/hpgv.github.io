| Technology      | 2026  | 2028  | 2030  | 2035  |

## Risk Management Considerations

### Peg Stability Mechanisms
Tether Limited maintains the USD peg through:
- Commercial paper reserves (60-70% of backing assets)
- Bank deposits and cash equivalents
- Other short-term investments

### Market Stress Indicators
Watch for these signals of potential peg instability:
- Significant premium/discount on over-the-counter markets
- Increased redemption requests
- Regulatory actions affecting stablecoin operations

## Strategic Investment Recommendations

Given Tether's unique characteristics, we recommend:
1. **Trading Reserve:** Maintain 10-15% of crypto portfolio in USDT for opportunistic buying
2. **Hedging Tool:** Use during high volatility periods rather than long-term holding
3. **Diversified Approach:** Combine with other stablecoins (USDC, BUSD) to mitigate counterparty risk

While our models project **+0.2% total return** from current prices by 2030, the primary value proposition remains preservation of capital rather than appreciation.

- DeFi protocol liquidity provision
- Yield-bearing stablecoin vaults
- Hybrid financial instrument collateral
