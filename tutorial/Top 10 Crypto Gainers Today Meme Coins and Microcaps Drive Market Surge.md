### Why Are Meme Coins Outperforming Larger Caps?  
**FAQ 1:** *What drives meme coin volatility?*  
Meme coins often lack intrinsic utility, making their valuations highly speculative. Social media trends, influencer endorsements, and short-term trading strategies primarily drive their price movements.  

**FAQ 2:** *Are microcap cryptocurrencies a viable investment?*  
While microcaps offer outsized returns, they carry extreme risks due to low liquidity and regulatory uncertainties. Experts recommend allocating only small portions of portfolios to these assets.  

**FAQ 3:** *How can traders identify sustainable meme coin projects?*  
Look for active development teams, transparent tokenomics, and real-world use cases. Projects with strong community engagement and clear roadmaps often outperform pure meme plays.
