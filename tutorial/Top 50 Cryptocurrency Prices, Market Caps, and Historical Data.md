## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q1: What determines a cryptocurrency's market cap?  
A: Market cap is calculated by multiplying the total circulating supply by the current price. For example, Bitcoin's $2.17T cap reflects its 19.4M circulating coins (as of this writing) multiplied by its $109,034 price.

### Q2: Why do meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain popular?  
A: Social media hype, celebrity endorsements (e.g., Elon Musk's tweets), and low entry costs attract retail investors, though these assets carry higher volatility and speculative risk.

### Q3: How do stablecoins maintain their $1 peg?  
A: Algorithms (e.g., USDT) or collateral reserves (e.g., USDC) back stablecoins. Tether (USDT) dominates with $158.44B market cap, though regulatory scrutiny persists.

### Q4: What drives volatility in cryptocurrencies?  
A: Factors include macroeconomic news (interest rates), exchange listings, security breaches, and technological upgrades (e.g., Ethereum's upcoming Dencun upgrade).

### Q5: Should I invest in top movers like Blast or Humanity Protocol?  
A: High-risk, high-reward assets require thorough research. Focus on projects with real-world use cases, like Blast's Layer 2 scaling solutions.

## Strategic Takeaways for Investors

1. **Diversify Across Categories**: Balance blue-chip cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH) with emerging sectors like AI (FET), NFTs (LYX), and DeFi (UNI).  
2. **Monitor Volume Spikes**: Sudden increases in trading volume (e.g., TRUMP tokens surging to $1.75B market cap) often signal short-term speculation.  
3. **Use Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Regular investments mitigate volatility risks in assets like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA).  
4. **Stay Informed**: Track regulatory updates, such as the U.S. SEC's stance on crypto ETFs, which impact market sentiment.
