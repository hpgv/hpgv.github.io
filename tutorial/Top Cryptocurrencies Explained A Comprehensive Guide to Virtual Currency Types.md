- Hedge against inflationary fiat currencies  

**Market Impact**:  
Bitcoin's dominance in market capitalization (often exceeding 40%) underscores its foundational role in cryptocurrency ecosystems. Institutional adoption, such as Tesla's $1.5 billion investment in 2021, has further legitimized its status.
